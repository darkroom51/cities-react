## Some Cities App

Simple React App, with data fetching, autosuggestion input and accordion component. My main goal was to create these components from scratch without using any much better ready sollutions. Was it a good idea? Well, at least it was fun :)

## Notes
You can only choose following countries: Poland, Germany, France, Spain. Due to API quirkiness, best to focus on the Polish cities.
